# JS-Object-Literals-The-DOM

Object Literals

Objects literals group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

Document Object Model

The browser represents the page using a DOM tree. DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax. Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nadeli st.
From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and
i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.
An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other.
In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).
Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree.
